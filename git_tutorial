In the bash shell, type:

Clone the reposistory using the HTTPS Clone link in GitLab
>>git clone https://git.uark.edu/dasc-2113/module-2.git

Make a change (in this case, I added a file called teams.ipynb)

Add the file to the local reposistory
>>git add teams.ipynb

Commit the change to the local reposistory with a commit message
>>git commit -m 'added notebook to randomly generate teams'

Push your lcoal repository changes to the central repository
>>git push
