# Using Git in this course

Git will be our primary method of delivering code-based assignments, lectures, data, etc. to you throughout the course. It is useful because it allows us to provide you with updates and corrections (if necessary) and for you to deliver your work to us in a trackable way. Every change you make you will be captured and you (and we) can go back to different versions of your work to see where a problem may have started.

We'll use both Git command line interface (CLI) and GitHub.com to manage the course and your personal repository.

The course has a GitHub organization account which you can join using your person GitHub account.
